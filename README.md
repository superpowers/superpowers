### Powerful, extensible, collaborative game development.

Superpowers is a downloadable HTML5 app. You can use it solo like a regular offline game maker,
or setup a password and let friends join in on your project through their Web browser.
It's great for working together over long periods of time, for jamming over a weekend,
or just for helping each other out with debugging!

#### ... not just for making games!

Here's the cool thing: Superpowers itself is actually engine-agnostic.
It's just a piece of software for collaborating on projects that can be extended with new systems and plugins!

 * [Superpowers Game](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game) — Make 2D+3D games with TypeScript, powered by Three.js
 * [Superpowers Web](http://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-web) — Make static websites with Jade and Stylus
 * [Superpowers LÖVE](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-love2d) — Make LÖVE 2D games with Lua

Learn [how to extend Superpowers yourself](http://docs.superpowers-html5.com/en/development/extending-superpowers).
Use it to make games, websites, slideshows, blogs, movies, apps, mods... whatever you can come up with!
